I hold a BSc and MSc in Computer Science and Engineering, and a PhD in Computer Science. All degrees were obtained at the [Technical University of Denmark](http://www.dtu.dk/English.aspx), with exchange visits in Pasadena, California, USA; Pisa, Italy and Bristol, UK.
As a PhD student, my advisors were [Philip Bille](http://www.philipbille.org "Philip Bille") and [Inge Li Gørtz](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~ilg/ "Inge Li Gørtz"). I was associated with the [Managed Video as a Service](http://hoejteknologifonden.dk/projektgalleri/projektgalleri/intelligent_videoovervaagning_til_private_hjem_og_offentlige_pladser/) 
Advanced Technology Foundation project.
The goal was to research and develop efficient data structures for storing massive amounts of data.

My PhD dissertation is a collection of the papers listed below (except for the last paper), with a short general introduction to the research field of algorithms and data structures. My masters thesis is a much extended version of the last paper.

#### Publications

I have written a number of papers on fundamental problems within the general field of algorithms and data structures. 
All are published in peer-reviewed international conferences (or currently in submission). A common theme is to design efficient data structures for problems that are real-world applicable.

### Abroad

I spent a bit of time abroad during my time in university, studying at five universities in four countries besides DTU. I also attended numerous international conferences.
