I hold a BSc & MSc in Computer Science and Engineering, and a PhD in Computer Science from the [Technical University of Denmark](http://www.dtu.dk/English.aspx). I was an exchange student at [Caltech](http://www.caltech.edu/) in Padadena, CA, USA and spent long research stays during my PhD at [Università di Pisa](https://www.unipi.it/index.php/english) in Italy and [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/) in the UK.

### PhD

I was advised by [Philip Bille](http://www.philipbille.org "Philip Bille") and [Inge Li Gørtz](http://www2.imm.dtu.dk/~ilg/ "Inge Li Gørtz") and associated with the [Managed Video as a Service](http://hoejteknologifonden.dk/projektgalleri/projektgalleri/intelligent_videoovervaagning_til_private_hjem_og_offentlige_pladser/) 
Advanced Technology Foundation project.
Its goal was to research and develop efficient data structures for handling massive amounts of data.

#### Publications

I am (co-)author of a number of papers within the general field of algorithms and data structures having efficient data structures for big data problems as a common theme:
