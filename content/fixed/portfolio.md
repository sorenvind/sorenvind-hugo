#### I love to create
I am optimistic, pragmatic and efficient. My ideal working environment is team-centric, dynamic, fun, and welcoming of opinions.

#### I am a generalist
I strongly believe that having a full-stack understanding is fundamental for creating good software: To be able to change, operate and reason about a system as a whole one has to understand the individual parts. 

<!-- I hold a [PhD in Computer Science]({{< ref "fixed/academia.md" >}}) and have published numerous papers on Algorithms and Data Structures research. I have years of experience operating and developing advanced software systems in multiple environments, both on the backend and frontend.  -->


## Experience
I have years of experience engineering advanced software systems for multiple platforms and on all layers of the stack -- from writing highly optimized GPU shaders in Swift/Metal, building scalable backend systems in Python to building great web experiences in Javascript. Five years of operations experience gives me an understanding of how to build maintainable systems.

### dev
I was a backend Java developer, architect and cloud engineer at [Kapow Software](http://kapowsoftware.com/) and [Tradeshift](http://tradeshift.com/).
As a full-stack softare engineer I worked with Python and Javascript at scale (10M+ users/day) in the new generation of the reading experience at [issuu](https://issuu.com), and at [Realm](https://realm.io) I helped build a new distributed database product.
Most recently at [Spektral](https://spektral.com) turning research-level machine learning and computer vision machinery into reality as a virtual green screen for the iPhone.

### ops
Five years of operations experience at [Octoshape](http://www.octoshape.com/), in charge of all aspects of IT infrastructure. In particular building, scaling and operating core infrastructure consisting of hundreds of globally hosted dedicated linux servers. I developed system automation tools before the cloud existed.

### var
(Co-)founder and head of technology for several start-ups, namely [peecee.dk](http://peecee.dk), [lokalvurdering.dk](http://lokalvurdering.dk) and [ruumier.com](http://ruumier.com). Volunteer network administrator and board member for various organizations.


## Misc
I care for the internet, privacy and anonymity. I was a significant opponent of the possible introduction of e-election in Denmark, organizing events and gathering interest. We won!
I host a [RIPE Atlas probe](https://atlas.ripe.net/probes/22029), a [PacketBot](https://www.packet.net/labs/packetbots) and a [flightradar24](https://www.flightradar24.com/) radar. I also spend quite some time running and have a deep passion for great food.

I have made various media appearences: [Berlingske: E-valg (danish)](http://www.b.dk/nationalt/it-eksperter-lunkne-over-for-e-valg),  [Version2: E-valg (danish)](http://www.version2.dk/artikel/margrethe-vestagers-svar-til-laeserne-om-e-valg-50476), [Politiken: Ruumier.com (danish)](http://politiken.dk/forbrugogliv/forbrug/ECE2429409/danskernes-deleoekonomi-er-naaet-ned-i-kaelderen/), [Prosa: MADALGO sommerskole (danish)](https://www.prosa.dk/bliv-medlem/nyhed/artikel/fuldt-hus-til-algoritmisk-sommerskole/).
