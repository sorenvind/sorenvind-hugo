#### I love to create
I like challenges and excel at solving complex problems.
As a person, I am optimistic, pragmatic and efficient. My ideal working environment is dynamic, fun, and welcoming of opinions.

#### I am a generalist 
I hold a [PhD in Computer Science]({{< ref "fixed/academia.md" >}}) and have published numerous papers on Algorithms and Data Structures research.
I have years of experience developing and operating advanced software systems, mostly on the backend.

My software development career includes building distributed systems and enterprise software in java, and backend development in various languages.

## Misc

I care for the internet, privacy and anonymity. I was a significant opponent of the possible introduction of e-election in Denmark, organizing events and gathering interest. We won! 
I host a [RIPE Atlas probe](https://atlas.ripe.net/probes/22029), a [PacketBot](https://www.packet.net/labs/packetbots) and operate a [TOR relay](https://globe.torproject.org/#/relay/ACC687BF3625EB8A283D6EFADA6FB04C57232D5E). I also spend quite some time [moving about](https://www.endomondo.com/profile/17622806).
